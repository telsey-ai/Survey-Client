## Planning Story

I thought it would be interesting to create a google forms clone for my capstone project.  I wanted to use ReactJS as the framework for the front end and express with JavaScript on the backend.

Before i started i created wireframes and an ERD for the application.

I wanted to allow users to make surveys and then allow other users to take those surveys.  I started by creating the models for the database first and then wrote the routes for them so that users could create, read, update and destroy surveys.

After the backend was working I implemented each feature one by one on the front end until all of the necessary functionality was built.
